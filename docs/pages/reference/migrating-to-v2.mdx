# Migrating to 2.0.0

During the EIP review process, there were changes to the initially proposed 1.0 version. This guide outlines the key changes between version 1.0 and the finalised 2.0.0 of EIP-5792, and provides guidance for migrating your implementation.

## Major Changes

### 1. Version Number

The version number in requests has been updated from `"1.0"` to `"2.0.0"`. This change reflects the significant updates to the specification during the review phase. Subsequent updates will follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

### 2. Atomic Capability

The `atomicBatch` capability has been replaced with a more expressive `atomic` capability that has three states:

- `supported`: The wallet will execute all calls atomically and contiguously
- `ready`: The wallet is able to upgrade to `supported` pending user approval (e.g. via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702))
- `unsupported`: The wallet does not provide any atomicity or contiguity guarantees

Example response:
```json
{
  "0x1": {
    "atomic": {
      "status": "supported"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Status Codes

The string-based status codes (`"PENDING"`, `"CONFIRMED"`) have been replaced with numeric status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 100  | Batch has been received by the wallet but has not completed execution onchain (pending) |
| 200  | Batch has been included onchain without reverts, receipts array contains info of all calls (confirmed) |
| 400  | Batch has not been included onchain and wallet will not retry (offchain failure) |
| 500  | Batch reverted **completely** and only changes related to gas charge may have been included onchain (chain rules failure) |
| 600  | Batch reverted **partially** and some changes related to batch calls may have been included onchain (partial chain rules failure) |

### 4. Request Structure

The `wallet_sendCalls` request structure has been updated:

- `chainId` is now a top-level property instead of being per-call
- Added `id` field for batch identification
- Added `atomicRequired` field to specify atomic execution requirements
- Removed per-call `chainId` fields

Example request:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "chainId": "0x1",
  "from": "0x...",
  "calls": [
    {
      "to": "0x...",
      "data": "0x...",
      "value": "0x0"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": {
    "atomic": {
      "required": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Response Structure

#### wallet_sendCalls Response

The `wallet_sendCalls` response structure has been updated:

- Changed from returning a simple string identifier to returning a structured object
- Added `capabilities` field for capability-specific metadata
- The `id` field is now part of a structured response rather than being returned directly as a string

Version 1.0 response:
```json
"0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
```

Version 2.0.0 response:
```json
{
  "id": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331",
  "capabilities": {
    "atomic": true
  }
}
```

#### wallet_getCallsStatus Response

The `wallet_getCallsStatus` response structure has been updated:

- Added `version` field
- Added `id` field
- Added `chainId` field
- Added `atomic` field to indicate how the batch was executed
- Changed status to numeric codes

Example response:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "id": "0x...",
  "chainId": "0x1",
  "status": 200,
  "atomic": true,
  "receipts": [...]
}
```

### 6. Additional Changes

#### wallet_getCapabilities Parameters

The `wallet_getCapabilities` method now accepts an optional array of chain IDs:

Version 1.0:
```json
["0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567"]
```

Version 2.0.0:
```json
["0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567", ["0x2105", "0x14A34"]]
```

This allows apps to query capabilities for specific chains, rather than getting all capabilities for all chains.

#### wallet_getCallsStatus Response Fields

Additional fields have been added to the `wallet_getCallsStatus` response:

- `version`: Indicates the version of the response format
- `atomic`: Explicitly indicates whether the batch was executed atomically

These fields help apps understand the format of the response and how the batch was executed.

## Migration Guide

### For Wallets

1. Update your version number to `"2.0.0"` in all responses
2. Replace `atomicBatch` capability with the new `atomic` capability
3. Update status codes to use numeric values
4. Implement the new request/response structures
5. Add support for the `atomicRequired` field in `wallet_sendCalls`
6. Ensure proper handling of the `id` field for batch identification
7. Update `wallet_sendCalls` to return a structured response with `id` and `capabilities` fields
8. Add support for chain-specific capability queries in `wallet_getCapabilities`
9. Include `version` and `atomic` fields in `wallet_getCallsStatus` responses

### For Apps

> Note that Viem ^2.28.0 has been updated to support the latest specification

1. Update your version number to `"2.0.0"` in all requests
2. Update capability checks to use the new `atomic` capability format
3. Update status code handling to use numeric values
4. Update request/response structure handling
5. Add support for the `atomicRequired` field when requiring atomic execution
6. Implement proper handling of the `id` field for batch identification
7. Update handling of `wallet_sendCalls` response to expect a structured object instead of a string
8. Add support for chain-specific capability queries in `wallet_getCapabilities`
9. Handle new `version` and `atomic` fields in `wallet_getCallsStatus` responses

## Backward Compatibility

While version 2.0.0 introduces significant changes, wallets and apps should maintain backward compatibility where possible:

- Wallets should continue to accept version `"1.0"` requests and respond appropriately
- Apps should be prepared to handle both old and new response formats
- When in doubt, check the version number in responses to determine the format

## Example Migration

Here's an example of migrating a `wallet_sendCalls` request and response from version 1.0 to 2.0.0:

Version 1.0:
```json
// Request
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "from": "0x...",
  "calls": [
    {
      "to": "0x...",
      "data": "0x...",
      "value": "0x0",
      "chainId": "0x1"
    }
  ]
}

// Response
"0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
```

Version 2.0.0:
```json
// Request
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "chainId": "0x1",
  "from": "0x...",
  "calls": [
    {
      "to": "0x...",
      "data": "0x...",
      "value": "0x0"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": {
    "atomic": {
      "required": true
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  "id": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331",
  "capabilities": {
    "atomic": true
  }
}
```
