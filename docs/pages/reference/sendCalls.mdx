# `wallet_sendCalls`

Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls. The wallet may execute these calls atomically (in a single transaction) or non-atomically (in multiple transactions), depending on the wallet's capabilities and the `atomicRequired` parameter.

## Example Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_sendCalls',
  params: [{
    version: '1.0',
    id: '0x123...',
    chainId: '0x01',
    from: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
    atomicRequired: true,
    calls: [
      {
        to: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
        value: '0x9184e72a',
        data: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675'
      },
      {
        to: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
        value: '0x182183',
        data: '0xfbadbaf01'
      }
    ],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: "https://...",
        optional: true
      }
    }
  }]
})
// @log: {
// @log:   "id": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
// @log: }
```

## Parameters

An array with a single object that contains the following fields:

* ### version
  * `string`
  * The version of the `sendCalls` API to use. Currently, '1.0' is the only version.

* ### id
  * `string` (optional)
  * A unique identifier for this batch of calls. If provided, must be a unique string up to 4096 bytes (8194 characters including leading `0x`). Must be unique per sender per app. If not provided, the wallet will generate a random ID.

* ### chainId
  * `Hex`
  * The chain ID to send the calls on. This is top level because all calls must be submitted on the same chain.

* ### from
  * `Address` (optional)
  * The address to send the calls from. If not provided, the wallet should allow the user to select the address during confirmation.

* ### atomicRequired
  * `boolean`
  * Specifies whether the wallet must execute all calls atomically (in a single transaction) or not. If set to `true`, the wallet MUST execute all calls atomically and contiguously. If set to `false`, the wallet MUST execute calls sequentially (one after another), but they need not be contiguous (other transactions may be interleaved) and some calls may fail independently.
  * If the wallet's `atomic` capability is `ready`, it MUST upgrade to `supported` before proceeding with atomic execution.

* ### calls
  * `Call[]`
  * The calls to submit. A `Call` is defined as an object that has the following fields:
    * to (optional)
      * `Address`
      * The address to send this call to. This field is optional because a call can be a contract creation.
    * value (optional)
      * `Hex`
      * Value in wei to send with this call.
    * data
      * `Hex`
      * The hash of the invoked method signature and encoded parameters OR the compiled code of a contract.
    * capabilities (optional)
      * `Record<string, Capability>`
      * Call-specific capability parameters

* ### capabilities
  * `Record<string, Capability>`
  * An object where the keys are capability names and the values are capability-specific parameters. The wallet MUST support all non-optional capabilities requested or reject the request.

## Returns

* `{ id: string, capabilities?: Record<string, any> }`

Returns an object containing:
- `id`: A call bundle identifier that can be used with `wallet_getCallsStatus` and `wallet_showCallsStatus`
- `capabilities`: Optional capability-specific response data
