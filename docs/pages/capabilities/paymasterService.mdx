# `paymasterService` Capability

:::warning
This capability is not finalized and might change.
:::

A capability for apps to communicate with wallets about ERC-4337 paymaster web services.

Defined in [ERC-7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677).

## Specification

### App

If you want to sponsor your users' transactions, you can do so by passing a paymaster service URL along with `wallet_sendCalls` requests. Specifically, you will need to include a `paymasterService` object in `capabilities`. This object should have a single field, `url`, that points to your paymaster service.

It's important to note that the URL you provide must be ERC-7677-compliant. If a connected wallet supports paymaster services, it will communicate with the provided URL according to ERC-7677 to get paymaster-related user operation fields.

#### Example

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_sendCalls',
  params: [{
    version: '1.0',
    chainId: '0x01',
    from: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
    calls: [
      {
        to: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
        value: '0x9184e72a',
        data: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675'
      },
      {
        to: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
        value: '0x182183',
        data: '0xfbadbaf01'
      }
    ],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: 'https://your-paymaster-service.xyz'
      }
    }
  }]
})
```

### Wallet

To support the `paymasterService` capability, a wallet must do two things:

1. Indicate it can leverage paymaster services as part of its response to a `wallet_getCapabilities` request.
2. Communicate with the paymaster service according to ERC-7677 if a `wallet_sendCalls` request includes a paymaster service URL.

#### `wallet_getCapabilities` Behavior

If a wallet is able to make use of paymaster web services to sponsor a user's call bundle, it should indicate this as part of its response to a `wallet_getCapabilities` request. Specifically, for each chain the wallet can use paymaster services on, its response to `wallet_getCapabilities` should include a `paymasterService` object. This object shoud have a single field, `supported`, set to `true`.

##### Example

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_getCapabilities',
  params: ['0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567']
})
// @log: {
// @log:   "0x2105": {
// @log:     paymasterService: {
// @log:       supported: true,
// @log:     }
// @log:   }
// @log: }
```

#### `wallet_sendCalls` Behavior

As outlined above, apps that wish to sponsor their users' transactions will provide a `paymasterService` capability object in their `wallet_sendCalls` requests. This `paymasterService` capability will have a `url` field, which indicates where wallets should send ERC-7677 paymaster RPC requests to.

Wallets will need to make two RPC requests to this URL:
1. `pm_getPaymasterStubData`
    * Returns dummy paymaster values to be used during gas estimation.
2. `pm_getPaymasterData`
    * Returns real paymaster values to be used during user operation submission.
