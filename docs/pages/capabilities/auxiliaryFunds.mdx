# `auxiliaryFunds` Capability

:::warning
This capability is not finalized and might change.
:::

Allows wallets to indicate to apps that they have access to funds beyond those that can be accounted for by looking up balances onchain given the wallet's address.

Defined in [ERC-7682](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7682-auxiliary-funds-capability/19599)

## Specification

### Wallet

If a wallet can provide its users access to funds beyond those that can be accounted for by looking up balances onchain given the wallet's address, its response to a `wallet_getCapabilities` request should include, for each chain it can provide access to such funds on, an `auxiliaryFunds` object. This object shoud have a single field, `supported`, set to `true`.

#### Example

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_getCapabilities',
  params: ['0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567']
})
// @log: {
// @log:   "0x2105": {
// @log:     auxiliaryFunds: {
// @log:       supported: true,
// @log:     }
// @log:   }
// @log: }
```

### App

If a wallet has indicated `auxiliaryFunds` support as described above, your app should not block users from taking actions on the basis of asset balance checks.
