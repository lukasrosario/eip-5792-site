# `flowControl` Capability

:::warning
This capability is not finalized and might change.

This is proposed in an open PR, [ERC-7867](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9259). This capability allows dapps to downgrade their required atomicity guarantees and control the behaviour after a failed/reverted call.
